# Basic Arithmetic Calculations
Web based Tools

The provided calculator tool is a simple web-based application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic calculations. It consists of two files:

1. **index.html:** This is the main HTML file that contains a form with input fields for two numbers and a dropdown menu to select an arithmetic operation (+, -, *, /). Upon submitting the form, the data is sent to the `calculator.php` file for processing.

2. **calculator.php:** This PHP file processes the form data received from the HTML file. It performs the selected arithmetic operation on the input numbers and displays the result on a new page. Error handling is included to handle division by zero and invalid operators.

Users can input values, choose an operation, and click the "Calculate" button. The result or an error message is then displayed on a separate page, along with a link to go back to the calculator. This is a basic illustration, and in a real-world scenario, additional features, security measures, and user interface improvements would be necessary.
